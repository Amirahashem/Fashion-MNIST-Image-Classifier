# Fashion MNIST Image Classifier

This project implements a neural network using TensorFlow and Keras to classify grayscale images of clothing from the Fashion MNIST dataset.

## Project Overview

- Loads and preprocesses the Fashion MNIST dataset (28x28 grayscale images of 10 clothing categories).  
- Visualizes sample images with labels.  
- Builds a Sequential neural network with Flatten and Dense layers.  
- Trains the model for 2 epochs.  
- Evaluates and reports model accuracy on the test set.

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- TensorFlow  
- Keras  
- Matplotlib  
- NumPy  

## How to Run

1. Install required packages:  
2. Run the script or notebook.

## Results

The model achieves good accuracy classifying 10 categories of fashion images.
